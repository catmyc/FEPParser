# FEPParser
A FEP Parser to replace the stupid code implemented in VMD

I started this project in Aug 2014 when I was really annoyed by the ParseFEP plugin of VMD, which was totally shit, unstable and unreliable!
Anyway, I've quitted my PhD project before this project could be finished. The free-energy calculation works pretty fine now, and the efficiency is far better than the stupid VMD Tcl script. What's left is the codes for error estimation. Maybe I'll fininsh it in the future.
Hopefully I may also make a GUI, perhaps.
